# Trustpilot Challenge

This is my solution to the [challenge proposed by Trustpilot.](https://followthewhiterabbit.trustpilot.com/cs/step3.html)

I divided the problem into two different parts:
- *Filtering the wordlist according to the informationwe they give to us:* This is critical because obtaining a good subset will dramatically decrease the time needed to find the correct solution. I choose python to solve this part because it allows a fast developing and 
- *Combine the wordlist, compute the md5 checksums and verify it:* I choose the C languaje for this part in order to obtin the lowest computation time.
